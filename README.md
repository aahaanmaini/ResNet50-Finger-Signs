# ResNet50 for Finger Signs Classification ðŸ¤šðŸ“Š

This project implements the ResNet50 convolutional neural network architecture from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras. It is trained on a custom hand sign language dataset to classify images into distinct sign categories.

The goal of this project was to understand residual learning and deep network architectures by manually constructing each block of ResNet50, rather than using prebuilt models or transfer learning.
